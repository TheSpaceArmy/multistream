# Multistream

Multistream is a prototype I have been working on which allows you to watch multiple streams at once and across services.

Please note this is still very much a work in progress project

## Current Supported Services:
- [twitch.tv](twitch.tv)
- [beam.pro](beam.pro)
- [ustream.tv](ustream.tv)

## Planned Services:
- [youtube.com](youtube.com)
- [livestream.com](livestream.com)
